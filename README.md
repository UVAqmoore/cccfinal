# Title: How Much is Bitcoin Worth: Pricing Differences Across Exchanges and Time
Team: Quentin Moore (qrm6ff)

Description: This project is two parts.  The first is analyzing the difference in the cost of bitcoin on various exchanges during the same time period.  The second part looks to see if these pricing differences across exchanges has changed over time (does one exchange always have lower prices, etc).  This should shed some light onto the reasons why bitcoin is priced differently - is it the locations the exchange serves, the convenience/speed of converting from fiat currency to bitcoin, a combination of these factors, or something else entirely?
